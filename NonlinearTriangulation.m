function [X] = NonlinearTriangulation(K, C1, R1, C2, R2, x1, x2, XO)
% C1 and R1: the first camera pose
% C2 and R2: the second camera pose
% x1 and x2: Nx2 matrices showing the corespondence between the 
% first and second images (N is the number of correspondences)
% XO: the 3D triangulated points through linear triangulation 
% (first estimation for nonlinear triangulation)
% X: Nx3 matrix represent the optimized 3D triangulated points
